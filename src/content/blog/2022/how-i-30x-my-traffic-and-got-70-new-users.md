Last Wednesday, I wanted to experiment with Reddit one more time and see how it went. I tried to post on Reddit a few times, but all of them went cricket ðŸ¦—. 

And to my surprise, This attempt was a great success ðŸ’ª ðŸ¥³.

![So this is the traffic during my post on Reddit that went wild.](/assets/img/2022/reddit-traffic/traffic-spike.png)

I got **30x** ðŸ¤¯ number of **unique visitors** compared to a typical boring day. And the avg visit duration is **not bad > 1m10s** ðŸ¤”, enough for people to finish seeing essential parts of the landing page.

By the way, here is my product for context: [https://sendtopod.com](http://sendtopod.com/?utm_campaign=tuancao.me&utm_source=tuancao.me-reddit-post-story&utm_medium=blog) - "Bookmark your article, and listen to them later on your favorite podcast".

And the best thing about this is that it converted to **76 people clicked** on Signup, which resulted in a **conversion rate of sweet 8.6%** (from Landing page -> Sign up page).

And it resulted in **70 new accounts created**.

## How It started

It started pretty boringly, depressing even. On Wednesday morning, I felt that my product was a failure; it was not going well (**Hint:** I still don't know if it's going to be a success or not), and I began to think about buying other people's side projects, which at least validated (have paying users) and had some tractions.  

But I know that I need to put on some reps even if I don't want to.

## How I posted on Reddit

The first step I took was to do some keyword research. As you already know, Reddit is huge, and finding where to post your stuff is quite a challenge in itself because:
- There are so many subreddits. Each has different requirements for self-promotion
- Each of them has a different affinity toward each kind of content

My product is pretty niche. And my assumption is that its best customers are people who are interested in consuming long-form content. And even this assumption seems incorrect (more on this in another article.)

Being pragmatic, what I searched for keywords like **"listen later"**, **"PodQueue"** (similar app) and see where similar content is posted, and I found a few candidates `r/longform` , `r/longread`  and `r/productivityApp`, finally `r/InternetIsBeatiful`

So I went ahead and read through each of sub-reddit rules to adhere to them while also trying to tell a story about how my product was created, hoping to make it exciting enough for people to check it out.

Here is the actual post:

## Focus on what works
After a few hours, posts on `LongRead`, `LongForm`, `SideProject`, `ProductivityApp` did not gain many upvotes, but... `InternetIsBeautiful` got quite a lot of views and even positive comments. So I stayed active on [that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/vsmbo9/bookmark_an_web_article_and_listen_to_them_later/) and answered any comments that came across.

This post on Reddit got **40K+ views** after a few hours, and eventually got to **90K+ views**.

After that, what I mostly did was to keep responding to comments and messages on Reddit

## Lesson learned
To summarize, here are a few lessons I learned:
- Building a SaaS product is hard, especially the mental aspect of it. You'll always be uncertain whether you should abandon it or keep going.
- Experiment with posting on different marketing channels, with different wording, perspective, presentations...
